# Saved-Code-Prior-to-Crash-
My laptop crashed recently, taking some of my recent projects with it. Here is some of what I saved on DropBox prior to the crash. 
Some of these programs are near-complete.

Program Descriptions 
1. clusternew.py is my attempt to built my own K-Means Clustering Algorithm. It's one of my first serious projects. I never fully decided the convergence criterion. 

2. goat.py generates a chart that compares the combined scoring & assisting rates of Lionel Messi & Cristiano Ronaldo

3. head2head.py attempts to visualize a team's scoring/conceeding rates using a colored matrix, data from SportsOpenData API

4. keepers.py compares save percentage of several Premier League goalkeepers, the results of which can be seen in Keepers.PNG as well as keepersNEW.png (the latter's code was very similar but was lost in the crash).

5. pandtest.py (specifically, SimpleGraph) is built to make matplotlib easier to interact with. It's what I used to make the majority of the static charts found on my blog. Once again the most updated version was lost in the crash, but the core functionality remained unchanged. 

6. parsetext.py is my attempt to recursively scrape transfer news data from The Guardian Website. I'd say it's 80% but I haven't worked on it for a while. 

7. priceInfoV3 compares team & player level valuations for several Premier League clubs

8. top_athletes.py attempts to scrape ESPN's top 100 athletes page for social popularity data. Unfortunately, the website didn't allow for it (rather, at the time I was to inexperienced to find a work-around).
